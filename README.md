# NLP-Disaster
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).  But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. the challenge is  to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
